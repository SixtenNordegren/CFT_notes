# CFT Notes

This repository contains notes on Conformal Field Theory (CFT). The notes aim to provide a concise and clear reference for key topics in CFT.

## Viewing Instructions

These notes are optimized for use with the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) app. Due to limitations in GitHub's markdown rendering, particularly for LaTeX expressions, proper formatting may not be displayed here.

## TODO
- Expand the statistical mechanics section.
- Add details on Ward identities.
