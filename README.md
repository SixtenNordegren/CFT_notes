### Note repository

This repository is a collection of notes in connection to a possible project on CFTs. These notes are mostly based on the ubiquitous "Conformal Field Theory" by Philippe Di Francesco, Pierre Mathieu, and David Senechal.

TODO (Hopefully in somewhat of an order):
1. Statistical mechanics up to critical phenomenon (at a minimum).
2. Ward Identities.
